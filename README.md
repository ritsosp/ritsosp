### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - I am Panos

I am a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in Visualization at [Bangor University](https://www.bangor.ac.uk/) in North Wales, UK. I lead the [XReality, Visualization and Analytics](https://xrvalab.github.io/) lab.

My research interests lie in the domain of human-computer interaction, and include mixed and virtual reality, information visualization and visual analytics. I am particularly interested in potential synergies between these fields within different flavours of human-data interaction, such as beyond-the-desktop visualization, and *ubiquitous*, *situated* and *immersive analytics*.
